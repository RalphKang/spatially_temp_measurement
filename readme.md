# Overview
This repo stores the code used in the paper "Comparative Analysis of Data-Driven Models for Spatially Resolved Thermometry Using Emission Spectroscopy". In this paper we discussed how to utilize systematical feature engineering and Machine Learning technologies for spatial temperature measurement along the lightpath. The repo is divided into three folders, they are respectively data generation, machine learning, deep learning.

# Data generation
In this folder, we reported how these data are generated through the packages of HAPI and HITEMP.

# Machine Learning
In this folder, all feature engineering methodologies and machine learning technologies we explored are presented

# Deep Learning
In this folder, all deep learning algorithms used are presented.

In addition to the code, a dataset repo is presented in kaggle, which could be found from the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ralphkang/emission-spectra
